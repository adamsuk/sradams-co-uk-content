## Personal Profile

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). Having made the transition to technology from an engineering background I relish focusing solely on the tools and approaches used in a modern web stack. My day-to-day involves a wide range of activities ranging from frontend developments (typically React), backend developments (typically Ruby on Rails), DevOps CI/CD pipelines and taking part in agile meetings and activities. I've held a variety of roles, predominantly software focused. My initial exposure to software development was as an engineer at Rolls-Royce. This role allowed me to learn analytical and simulation skills in a wide range of exciting and varied projects in the nuclear sector.
Following this engineering specific exposure to software development I wanted to experience a modern development approach. I joined a small and faced paced FinTech, initially as a Platform Engineer but shortly moving back to development as a Senior Software Engineer, a role I've enjoyed since at RPF. My career to date has benefited significantly from the transferable skills I obtained from my academic, teaching and engineering experiences. This has allowed me present to various levels of senior management, apply coaching techniques to peers and efficiently inform and engage stakeholders.
