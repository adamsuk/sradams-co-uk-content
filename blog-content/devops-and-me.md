I've been making random entries into this blog for a while now. That and conference season is coming back around I'm in full nostalgia mode. This post is personal and based on my professional experiences to date about how I am where I am.

For years I worked in the Nuclear industry with Rolls-Royce. I joined a department of ~50 people with extremely similar, vague job titles. I found code early with Matlab and C but feel in love with Python when I joined [SMRs](https://www.rolls-royce.com/innovation/small-modular-reactors.aspx#/). I dabbled, lead and pioneered some big changes in nuclear method developments, utilising aging codes such as [RELAP](https://relap53d.inl.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx) and [COBRA-TF](https://www.ne.ncsu.edu/rdfmg/cobra-tf/), all wrapped in Python. A couple of years later, during my second stint at SMRs, a Bill Gates led nuclear company called [TerraPower](https://www.terrapower.com/) where exponentially ramping up; they'd spent the last decade developing methods to exploit tech for design gains. I can tell you now there's nothing worse than someone doing what you always talked about and achieving exactly what you thought it could do.

I did what I could and as a result of Covid-19 pieced together hardware knocking around the office. I made a small off-grid network to run simulations remotely for a small team. I used Gitlab, Puppet, MySQL and Docker and hosted a bunch of servers from my home office. I spread the word through [GitLab Commit](https://gitlabcommitvirtual2020.sched.com/speaker/sra405) (because of an email I recieved calling for talks due to me signing up to the community version) and [DevOps Live](https://www.cloudexpoeurope.com/devops-live/virtual-2020) (due to the reception I had from Gitlab Commit), gaining traction in [internet blogs](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/devops/rolls-royce-embraces-devops-approach-drive-nuclear-power-project) with the Rolls-Royce name. What we were doing was basic, but due to the industry, impossible to get off the ground. As a result of the pandemic I had a chance and genuinely believed any tech-based company or conference would laugh us out the room. Instead they embraced us. We were using tools they knew were great for a purpose they didn't fully understand. They understood the drive for change better than any manager I talked to.

There's one reason my work and achievements over a short space of time reasonated in the tech industry more than my own ... DevOps. The tools I was using got my foot in the door, discussing interesting topics with people in all sorts of industries, but peoples overwhelmingly positive reception to it was because of the community and mindset DevOps insills.

I left the nuclear industry not long after. Central IT tried to take down my off-grid network and method developments stalled. I can't tell for certain what the feelings were towards my work but it was always seen as an experiment whilst I was there. It could've been something great, utilising tech to bring together dispersed development teams in different cities and companies.

I couldn't be happier with my decision. DevOps is now part of my day-to-day and I'm surrounded by like-minded people. Disciplines are (rightly) seperated, whilst DevOps blurs the boundaries and encourages openness. I love tech, but I love DevOps principles more.
