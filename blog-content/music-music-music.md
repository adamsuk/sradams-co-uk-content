So I used to play a fair bit back in the day. A few of these recordings and videos are still available. I used one of these to give iFrames a go in combination with my global theme. It was an interesting test playing with heights and widths in combination with the Layout component.

Future implementations:
- embedded music player
- embedded spotify playlist
