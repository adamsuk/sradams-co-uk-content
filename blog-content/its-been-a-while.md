I want to get back into this keep pushing forward with front-end tech. Its been too long since I worked on a personal project.

What have I been up to... working mainly. But I wanted to document the cool tech I've been tinkering with.
- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) - actual infrastructure as code! I wrote a PoC spinning up all sorts of GCP resources using only Javascript! It's early days but this has a ton of promise.
- Github Actions - I've been pretty knee deep in CI for well over a year now. Firstly I tinkered with Gitlab on a self-hosted instance spinning up dedicated runners, then I moved onto CircleCI. Github Actions is a complete breath of fresh air. The number of pre-existing integrations and support with GCP is insane! I coupled my Pulumi code with Github Actions spinning up resources in less than 30 lines of code!?
- Netlify - I've not played with this as much but it's on the horizon. This sites hosted by Vercel which is a similar offering but there's a heap of questions I need to answer before jumping into a no-code front-end platform in my day job.

That's all folks. Other than a smidge of Auth0, MongoDB and Checkly there's not much more to add.

Note to self: look into that Checkly terraform provider!
