I wanted to give myself a little space to deploy some small, potentially bug filled nuggets... welcome MY SANDBOX!

My first addition is a little code I completed as part of an interview assessment. I applied for a Python Dev position and was handed a generic assessment with all sorts on it with the expectation of completing ~50%. My first submission was positively received but a few minor points and considerations were given. So with this I went all out and attempted a fairly hefty question about deploying a JavaScript based calculator or the big wide web. With zero JS or web experience I taught myself enough to give them something that'd host an instance on localhost. With this and more I heard absolutely nothing. Pan to less than 6 months later and I found my perfect job and learnt enough to put the same code (with a few minor tweaks to get it working on Next.js) on this site.

I couldn't be happier and I'm extremely glad I didn't give that particular company any more of my time :)

I'm sure I'll add all sorts in this sandbox. I've had a few in my time but normally these consist of random directories or a random bit of tech after I've install a new OS ... so they don't last long. This one's by far the most polished... mmmmm Next.js ....
