## Personal Profile
I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Koodoo](https://koodoo.io/). This has allowed me to focus solely on development tools and approaches used in a modern technology stack.
My day-to-day involves a wide range of activities ranging from frontend developments (typically Next.js), backend developments (typically Express.js), DevOps CI/CD pipelines and taking part in scoping/planning activities.
I've held a variety of roles, predominantly software focused. My initial exposure to software development was as a Thermo-Fluid Engineer at Rolls-Royce. This role allowed me to learn analytical and simulation skills in a wide range of exciting and varied projects in the nuclear sector, both civil and marine.
I have led various python based developments, from design/develop through to integration and user acceptance testing, initially utilising waterfall then championing DevOps principles.
My career to date has benefited significantly from the transferable skills I obtained from my academic, teaching and engineering experiences. This has allowed me present to various levels of senior management, apply coaching techniques to peers and efficiently inform and engage stakeholders.

## Education and Work Experience
***
### Senior Software Engineer, Koodoo - Mortgage Power Ltd (08/2021 - Present)
#### Fully Remote
- Responsible for developing and maintaining various parts frontend and backend applications.
- Partaking in the agile sprint cycle with input into planning and estimation as well as peer code reviews.
- Produced proof-of-concepts and developer tools such as useful CLI commands and migration to a shared component library.
***
### Platform Engineer, Koodoo - Mortgage Power Ltd (11/2020 - 08/2020)
#### Fully Remote
- Responsible for provisioning and maintaining the businesses cloud infrastructure (predominantly GCP but includes resources in AWS and Azure).
- I provisioned the infrastructure from initial development to production for two major projects in the company (including terraform for GCP resources and 3rd party products such as Auth0 and Sentry).
- Responsible for the CI/CD pipelines across the business.
- I wrote the whole pipeline for the adoption of Next.js and Helm in CircleCI utilising the Orb structure and introduced significant improvements to existing pipelines (automation of terraform repositories, pipeline image generation/push to a private registry and tag based deployments for front and backend repositories).
- Produced proof-of-concepts for new tools and services such as Pulumi, Helm, Lighthouse, Github Actions and Netlify.
- Assisted GCP cluster migration (staging and production). This included transfer of deployments using Velero and updating pipelines to populate a new private container registry and update services.
***
### Performance Methods Lead, Rolls-Royce - UK SMR (02/2020 - 11/2020)
#### Rolls-Royce, Jubilee House, Derby.
- Responsible for the development, maintenance and integration of the Small Modular Reactor (SMR) thermal hydraulic analysis method. This predominantly includes the expansion of the overarching programme methods framework (of which the thermal hydraulic method was the most mature and leading the way), integrate with other methods and expanding our code base (with soft and hard coupled techniques).
- As a result of COVID-19 I implemented and distributed 7 development machines and maintained the server machine (utilising Ubuntu, Puppet, GitLab, Docker, MySQL and OpenSSL) enabling a team to continue as normal through the first year of the pandemic.
- Authored two workstream strategies, one for Thermal Hydraulic analysis/methods and another for Modelling and Analytics (detailing the route to cloud computing, from defining how to develop a discipline specific analysis method to integrating and coupling to other methods).
***
### Section Lead - Fatigue and Fracture Framework (02/2018 - 02/2020)
#### Rolls-Royce, Raynesway, Derby.
- Section leader for an ambitious cross-business unit integration project linking thermal hydraulic response to component fatigue, responsible for planning, monitoring and programme delivery.
- Responsible for two direct reports and the integration of work from another three engineers.
- During this time I also provided value to the department by developing and integrating a database and UI for displaying concessions data in Virtual Reality (using C#, MySQL and Unity VR).
***
### Thermo-Fluid Engineer (01/2016 - 02/2018)
#### Rolls-Royce, Raynesway, Derby.
- Completed all code validation activities for an extensive LOCA test rig programme.
- Developed a flexible thermal hydraulic performance analysis method (predominately Python based) to inform the design of the Rolls-Royce led UK SMR programme (initially as a developer and later becoming the workstream lead for key analysis and analysis method update developments) – 18 month placement at Jubilee House
***
### MSc Physics and Technology of Nuclear Reactors (09/2014 - 12/2015)
#### Distinction - University of Birmingham
- MSc thesis based on code validation for a set of thermodynamic phenomena.
***
### Teacher of Science (08/2013 - 07/2014)
#### Long Field Academy, Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.
- Accountable for lesson delivery to meet learning and scheme of work objectives for pupils across key stages 3 and 4 (11-16) in Biology, Chemistry and Physics.
***
#### PGCE Secondary Science with Physics Enhancement (08/2012 - 07/2013) - Outstanding - University of Chester
***
#### BSc Physics (09/2009 - 07/2012) - 2:2 (Hons) - University of Leicester
