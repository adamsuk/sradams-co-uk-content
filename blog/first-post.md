So this is going to detail aspects I've learnt on my Next.js, frontend, fullstack journey. 

With all due respect this isn't for anyone except me :D I don't expect this to be top of any Google search or make its way onto Medium or anyother large blogging/article site. This is all for me.

So my journey so far has been:
- Produce a basic Next.js app
- Host the site as a static site with GCP
- So to the server-side and host on a small Kubernetes cluster
- Run out of free GCP credits so migrate to Vercel (which is awesome by the way!)
- Tweak the site layout (CSS :S)
- Deploy this Markdown blog functionality
- Leave the final theme solution for another night.

TODOs:
- Iron out CI/CD with Vercel instead of GCP
- Iron out general site theme (LAYOUT!!)
- Additional pages (e.g. Music, CV?)
- Share additional code and get stuck into more projects.
